                            Our code is open for all to see, so more developers can identify and
                            fix potential security vulnerabilities faster. And because the open-source community is huge
                            and active, more people are looking for bugs and fixing them more often. Open source products
                            are not restricted by licensing agreements, so they are affordable for people and
                            organizations of all sizes.
