                With our monorepo we provide centralized management and control that makes it easy to keep track of
                changes, dependencies, and versions. Increased code reuse means less code needs to be written from
                scratch making it easier to update and maintain.

                Because our tools are desiged to be data-agostic, they can be reused in different applications, easily
                switched between different data sources, and customized to meet specific requirements. We build for
                small projects to enterprise deployments with multiple data sources.
